## Prerequisites 
foss.crave.io account

- Download crave.conf from API Keys of foss.crave.io dashboard

![Repository Secrets](assets/cravetoken.png)

- Create a Repository Secret called CRAVE_USERNAME, with username from crave.conf
- Create a Repository Secret called CRAVE_TOKEN, with authentication token from crave.conf
![Repository Secrets](assets/secrets.png)
![Repository Secrets](assets/secrets2.png)

- Go to Settings -> Code and Automation -> Actions -> General
- Set workflow Permissions to "Read and Write Permissions" and save.
- Now you are ready to build! Go to "Crave Builder" workflow and start building
## Selfhosted Runners:
These runners sit in crave devspace CLI or your personal server and run the workflow on there. Use this if you need to bypass the 6 hours timeout limit.

## Extra Setup For Selfhosted runner:
- Follow the above steps
- On the top menu bar of the repository, click on Actions
- Self-Hosted Runner -> New Runner
![Self Hosted Runners](assets/runners.png)
- Scroll down and copy the Runner Token(avoid closing this tab till the process is done)

- Go back to Actions, select "Create Selfhosted Runner"
- Run Workflow and enter your Runner token.
Ensure you have no random spaces before or after

- Start the workflow
- After this is done, you are ready to build! Go to the "Crave Builder(self-hosted)" workflow and start building
(If the runner is offline still, trigger "Start/Restart Selfhosted Runner" workflow to force-restart the selfhosted runner)

## Required Secrets
### CRAVE_USERNAME (Required)
This is the email you signed up to crave with 

example: 
```
person@example.com
```
### CRAVE_TOKEN (Required)
This is the Authorization part of the crave.conf. It should not contain `:`, spaces, or `,`

### CUSTOM_YAML (Optional)
If this exists, the crave.yaml will be overridden while running the workflow

example:
```
CipherOS:
  ignoreClientHostname: true
Arrow OS:
  ignoreClientHostname: true
DerpFest-aosp:
  ignoreClientHostname: true
LOS 20:
  ignoreClientHostname: true
LOS 21:
  ignoreClientHostname: true
```

## Inputs Explanation
### Base Project
    - These are the projects everyone can build, with a foss.crave.io account
    - These are the ones officially added
### Repo init Command
    - This is only for when you are initializing another ROM. When doing this, ensure you are initializing on top of closest cousin base project
    - Don't initialize android 14 on top of android 13 projects
    - If you just type 'skip', it will skip the compilation. This is useful for uploading and debugging
### Removals
    - When we resync another ROM on top, we are bound to get "cannot checkout" errors. To fix this, we add that folder to the Removals tab
    - Add a space after .repo/local_manifests and add these folders. Don't change if you don't need to
    - Almost defunct now, since /opt/crave/resync.sh script on crave handles everything for us
### Local Manifest
    - Here you enter the git repo and branch for your local manifests, containing device specific repositories. These will be cloned to .repo/local_manifests
### Device Details
    - Enter the device codename you want to build for inside DEVICE_NAME
    - Enter the makefile name(without the .mk) inside MAKEFILE_NAME
### Build Command
    - eg. m updatepackage, mka bacon, make recoveryimage
### Build Type
    - Choose the build type
- user:  Limited access; suited for production

- userdebug:  Like user but with root access and debug capability; very close to production performance

- eng:  Development configuration with faster build time; most suited for day-to-day development
### Clean Build
  - Uses fresh Base Project sources without any of your changes(use only for testing/debugging)

## Known Issues
  - You Tell Me :)
## Extra Info
  - For scheduled builds, it's better to remove the workflow dispatch stuff, check [lineage_builder](https://github.com/a57y17lte-dev/lineage_builder) for reference.
  - This Repo is a spiritual successor to azwhikaru's Action-TWRP-Builder
