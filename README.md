## Inputs Explanation
### Base Project
    - These are the projects everyone can build, with a foss.crave.io account
    - These are the ones officially added
### Repo init Command
    - This is only for when you are initializing another ROM. When doing this, ensure you are initializing on top of closest cousin base project
    - Don't initialize android 14 on top of android 13 projects
### Removals
    - When we resync another ROM on top, we are bound to get "cannot checkout" errors. To fix this, we add that folder to the Removals tab
    - Add a space after .repo/local_manifests and add these folders. Don't change if you don't need to
### Local Manifest
    - Here you enter the git repo and branch for your local manifests, containing device specific repositories. These will be cloned to .repo/local_manifests
### Device Details
    - Enter the device codename you want to build for inside DEVICE_NAME
    - Enter the makefile name(without the .mk) inside MAKEFILE_NAME
### Build Command
    - eg. m updatepackage, mka bacon, make recoveryimage
### Build Type
    - Choose the build type
- user:  Limited access; suited for production

- userdebug:  Like user but with root access and debug capability; very close to production performance

- eng:  Development configuration with faster build time; most suited for day-to-day development
### Clean Build
  - Uses fresh Base Project sources without any of our changes(use only for testing/debugging)

## Known Issues
  - You Tell Me :)
## Project Explanation
  - For scheduled builds, it's better to remove the workflow dispatch stuff.
  - This Repo is a spiritual successor to azwhikaru's Action-TWRP-Builder
